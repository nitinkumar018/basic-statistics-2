## Estimation And Confidence Intervals
In quality control processes, especially when dealing with high-value items, destructive sampling is a necessary but costly method to ensure product quality. The test to determine whether an item meets the quality standards destroys the item, leading to the requirement of small sample sizes due to cost constraints. In our problem statement, a manufacturer of print-heads for personal computers is interested in estimating the mean durability of their print-heads in terms of the number of characters printed before failure. To assess this, the manufacturer conducts a study on a small sample of print-heads due to the destructive nature of the testing process.
